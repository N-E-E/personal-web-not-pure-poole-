title: About Me
---


Hi, welcome to my personal website. I am a 3th year undergraduate student from Huazhong University of Science and Technology(HUST) majoring in Computer Science. I am passionate about computer architecture, including High Performance System, MLSys, and Next Generation Archs(CPUs, Compilers and Memorys).
My CV is available at here. (add links)

## Research Experience
#### 10/2022-11/2022: Scheduling of Data Retrieval Tasks in Tape Cloud Storage Systems(HUAWEI Coding Challenge)
- A short time research experience, mentored by Prof. You Zhou
- In this research, the team and I solve a Data Retrieval Task and aim to minimize the tasks-waiting time under some limitations. What I did in this project is to discuss with team members, and do coding jobs to verify strategies.

#### 01/2022-02/2022: Heterogeneous Graph Processing System with GPUs/FPGAs
- Under the supervision of Prof. Long Zheng
- In this project, what I mainly did is to get started in computer architecture and graph processing system. I spent some time learning CUDA programming and Verilog HDL(and a little xilinx hls) so that I can read source code of some papers. I think it is important skills for verifying my research ideas in computer arch.


#### 07/2023-present: Vision Transformer Acceleration under graph processing perspective
- With the assistance of Ph.D.graduate Yu Huang, under the supervision of Prof.Zheng Long
- It's a challenging experience for me but I enjoy and benefit a lot in the experience!
- In the beginning, I read some papers in LLM system optimization and acceleration, especially the acceleration techniques in attention mechanism.(sparsity, checkpoint, quantization, pruning and so on)
- Discussing with Ph.D.graduate Yu Huang. Searching and reading papers in transformer(mainly in attention mechanism) optimization with Graph methods. The key target is to solve the memory bound problem(increase FLOPS/BytesAccess). Inspired by order invariance of transformer and the similaration between graph and image, we propose "Img2Graph" and "Reorder" operations. An image can be transform to a graph, and then a "Reorder Operation" can be used to reorder the image patches from a graph, making similar patches stay together after the flatten operation in ViT. That is simple to make use of differentiated sparsity/quantization in matrix multiplication in the following progress.
- Do some experiments to verify ideas, and discuss with Mr.Huang.
