Hi, welcome to my personal website. I am a 3th year student from Huazhong University of Science and Technology(HUST), and I major in Computer Science. Besides, I am passionate about computer architecture, including High Performance System, Next Generation Archs(CPUs, Compilers and Memorys) and MLSys.
My CV is available at here. (add links)

## Research Experience
#### 10/2022-11/2022: Scheduling of Data Retrieval Tasks in Tape Cloud Storage Systems(HUAWEI Coding Challenge)
- A short time research experience, mentored by Prof. Zhou You
- In this research, the team and I solve a Data Retrieval Task and aim to minimize the tasks-waiting time under some limitations. What I did in this project is to discuss with team members, and do coding jobs to verify strategies.

#### 12/2022-02/2022: High Performance Graph Processing System with GPUs/FPGAs
- Under the supervision of Prof.Zheng Long
- In this project, what I mainly did is to study knowledge in computer archs and graph processing systems. I read some papers in graph processing system. Then I spent some time learning CUDA programming and Verilog HDL so that read source code of some papers. I think it is important skills for verifying my research ideas in computer arch.

#### 07/2023-09/2023: Vision Transformer Acceleration under graph processing perspective
- With the assistance of Ph.D.graduate Huang Yu, and under the supervision of Prof.Zheng Long
- It's a challenging experience for me but I enjoy and benefit a lot in that summer vacation.
- I read some papers in LLM system optimization and acceleration, especially the acceleration techniques in attention mechanism.(sparsity, checkpoint, quantization, pruning and so on)
- Discussing with Ph.D.graduate Huang Yu. Search and read papers in transformer(mainly in attention mechanism) optimization with Graph methods. The key target is to lessen the computation/data transfer cost. Inspired by order invariance of transformer and the similaration between graph and image, an image can be transform to a graph, and then a "Reorder Operation" can be used to reorder the image patches from a graph, making similar patches stay together after flattening the 2d image. That is simple to make use of SpMM and DDMM in the matrix multiplication in the following progress.  
- Do experiments to verify ideas, and discuss with Huang.
